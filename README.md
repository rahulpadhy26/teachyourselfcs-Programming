#### I've decided to strengthen myself more in CS concepts, and hence I'm trying to follow the contents given in [teachyourselfcs](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)

#### So, the 1st part is Programming, and instead of following the SICP material, I've decided to go ahead with [composingprograms](https://composingprograms.com/), probably since the material is in Python.


#### I've decided to keep this ReadMe as sort of a log to update and remind myself about the progress that I make in it. Let's see how much I can proceed!
